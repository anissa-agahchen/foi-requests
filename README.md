# About 
This repo was created to be the future home of a new application for citizens to submit Freedom of Information (FOI) requests.

[Here is the existing online form](https://forms.gov.bc.ca/governments/foi/) for submitting FOI requests.

[Here is a clickable PDF prototype](https://github.com/bcgov/foi-requests/raw/master/FOI_Alpha_prototype.pdf) of how we want the new appplication to work.
